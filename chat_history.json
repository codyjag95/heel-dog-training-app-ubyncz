You want me to create a plan for a React Native + Expo 54 app called \"HEEL\" for modern dog training. The app should have a sleek, athletic, premium dark mode UI with red accents, and function like a gym workout app for dog training. Here's the plan:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n*   **Home/Training Hub:** Display dog name, progress summary, and training categories (Everyday Obedience, Leash & Walks, Calm & Focus, Recall, Mental Work) as clean cards or tiles.\n*   **Category Screen:** Show a list of lessons within the selected category, including lesson name, difficulty, estimated time, and locked/unlocked status.\n*   **Lesson Screen:** Display a video or illustrated lesson at the top, followed by step-by-step instruction cards, a \"Start Session\" button, and a \"Mark Complete\" button.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Theme:** Dark Mode\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: #121212 (Charcoal)\n    *   Text: #FFFFFF (White)\n    *   TextSecondary: #A0A0A0 (Gray)\n    *   Primary: #FF3B30 (Red)\n    *   Secondary: #1E1E1E (Dark Gray)\n    *   Accent: #FF3B30 (Red)\n    *   Card: #1E1E1E (Dark Gray)\n    *   Highlight: #FF3B30 (Red)\n*   **Typography:** Modern, clean fonts (e.g., San Francisco, Roboto)\n*   **Icons:** Minimal, line-based icons\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Project Setup:** Create a new React Native project with Expo.\n2.  **Navigation:** Implement navigation using React Navigation. This will include:\n    *   A stack navigator for the main app flow (Home, Category, Lesson, Progress, Premium Upgrade).\n    *   A separate stack navigator or modal for the Onboarding flow (Create Account/Log In, Add Dog Profile).\n3.  **Screens:** Create the following screens:\n    *   Onboarding:\n        *   Create Account/Log In\n        *   Add Dog Profile (name, age, breed optional)\n    *   Home/Training Hub\n    *   Category Screen\n    *   Lesson Screen\n    *   Progress Screen\n    *   Premium Upgrade Screen\n4.  **Components:** Create reusable components for:\n    *   Training Category Cards/Tiles\n    *   Lesson List Items\n    *   Instruction Cards\n    *   Buttons (Start Session, Mark Complete)\n    *   Progress Bars\n5.  **Data:** Define data structures for:\n    *   Dog Profile\n    *   Training Categories\n    *   Lessons (including video/image URLs, instructions, difficulty, time)\n6.  **Logic:** Implement basic logic for:\n    *   Marking lessons as complete\n    *   Tracking progress\n    *   Locking/unlocking lessons based on premium status\n    *   Displaying ads for free users\n7.  **Styling:** Apply the specified dark mode UI and red accent highlights to all screens and components.\n\nNow, I will instruct the coding agent to implement the plan and modify the app/(tabs) folder to implement the changes and make the changes visible for the user.\n\nFinally, the coding agent should remove the modalDemos array from app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-12-13T22:55:49.112212"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll build the HEEL dog training app for you!

This is a common issue with Expo projects, and while the error message itself is generic, it usually points to a problem in the build configuration or environment.\n\nHere's a breakdown of potential causes and how to address them:\n\n1.  **Node Modules Issues:**\n    *   **Inconsistent Dependencies:** Delete your `node_modules` folder, and `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock` file. Then run `npm install` or `yarn install` to ensure you have a clean and consistent set of dependencies.\n    *   **Native Module Compatibility:** Some native modules might have compatibility issues with the Expo SDK version you're using. Check the documentation for each native module to ensure it's compatible. If not, you might need to update the module or downgrade your Expo SDK version.\n\n2.  **Expo Configuration:**\n    *   **`app.json` or `app.config.js`:** Review your Expo configuration file for any syntax errors or misconfigurations.\n    *   **Conflicting Plugins:** Ensure there are no conflicting plugins in your `app.json` or `app.config.js` file.\n\n3.  **EAS Build Configuration:**\n    *   **`eas.json`:** Check your EAS build configuration file for any errors.\n    *   **Build Secrets:** Verify that any required build secrets (API keys, etc.) are correctly configured in EAS.\n\n4.  **Environment Issues:**\n    *   **Node.js Version:** Ensure you're using a compatible Node.js version. Expo recommends using an LTS version.\n    *   **Global Packages:** Outdated or conflicting global packages can sometimes cause issues. Try updating `expo-cli` globally: `npm install -g expo-cli`.\n\n5.  **Caching Issues:**\n    *   **Metro Bundler Cache:** Reset the Metro bundler cache by running `expo start -c`.\n    *   **EAS Build Cache:** Clear the EAS build cache by running `eas build --clear-cache`.\n\nGiven that you've already tried some fixes related to `react-native-maps` and bundle identifiers, I recommend focusing on the following steps:\n\n1.  **Clean Install:** Delete `node_modules`, `package-lock.json` (or `yarn.lock`), and run `npm install` (or `yarn install`).\n2.  **Review Expo Configuration:** Carefully examine your `app.json` or `app.config.js` file for any errors.\n3.  **Update Expo CLI:** Ensure you have the latest version of `expo-cli` installed globally.\n4.  **Clear Caches:** Reset the Metro bundler cache (`expo start -c`) and the EAS build cache (`eas build --clear-cache`).\n\nIf the issue persists, please provide the following information so I can assist you further:\n\n*   Your `app.json` or `app.config.js` file.\n*   The exact Expo SDK version you're using.\n*   The Node.js version you're using.\n*   The output of `expo doctor`.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-12-21T08:57:58.273923"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you fix this build error.

Try clearing the cache by running `expo start -c`.\n4.  **Restart the Development Server:** After clearing the cache, restart the Expo development server to ensure the changes are picked up.\n\nIf the issue persists after these steps, there might be a problem with how the dependency is being imported or used in your code.

But having `react-native-worklets` installed can cause conflicts during the export/build phase\n\nSince you're not using `react-native-worklets` anywhere in your code, we should remove it from package.json. However, I cannot modify package.json dependencies directly through the tools available. \n\nInstead, let me provide you with the solution:\n\n## Solution\n\nThe issue is caused by having `react-native-worklets` (version 0.5.1) installed alongside `react-native-reanimated` 4.x. These two packages conflict because Reanimated 4.x has worklets functionality built-in.\n\n**To fix this error, you need to:**\n\n1. **Remove the conflicting dependency** by running this command in your terminal:\n   ```bash\n   npm uninstall react-native-worklets\n   ```\n   or if using yarn:\n   ```bash\n   yarn remove react-native-worklets\n   ```\n\n2. **Clear your build cache:**\n   ```bash\n   expo start -c\n   ```\n\n3. **Try building again:**\n   ```bash\n   eas build -p ios --profile development\n   ```\n\nThe babel configuration is already correct - it's using `react-native-reanimated/plugin` which is the right plugin for Reanimated 4.x.\n\n---\n\n**Why this happens:**\n\n- `react-native-reanimated` version 4.x includes worklets functionality natively\n- Having a separate `react-native-worklets` package creates conflicts during the build/export phase\n- The Expo export process fails because it encounters conflicting worklet implementations\n\n**After removing the package**, your app should build successfully without any code changes needed!"}, {"type": "lint", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "lint", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "build", "build_type": "build", "status": "complete", "success": true}], "timestamp": "2025-12-21T09:45:23Z"}]
