You want me to create a plan for a React Native + Expo 54 app called \"HEEL\" for modern dog training. The app should have a sleek, athletic, premium dark mode UI with red accents, and function like a gym workout app for dog training. Here's the plan:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n*   **Home/Training Hub:** Display dog name, progress summary, and training categories (Everyday Obedience, Leash & Walks, Calm & Focus, Recall, Mental Work) as clean cards or tiles.\n*   **Category Screen:** Show a list of lessons within the selected category, including lesson name, difficulty, estimated time, and locked/unlocked status.\n*   **Lesson Screen:** Display a video or illustrated lesson at the top, followed by step-by-step instruction cards, a \"Start Session\" button, and a \"Mark Complete\" button.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Theme:** Dark Mode\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: #121212 (Charcoal)\n    *   Text: #FFFFFF (White)\n    *   TextSecondary: #A0A0A0 (Gray)\n    *   Primary: #FF3B30 (Red)\n    *   Secondary: #1E1E1E (Dark Gray)\n    *   Accent: #FF3B30 (Red)\n    *   Card: #1E1E1E (Dark Gray)\n    *   Highlight: #FF3B30 (Red)\n*   **Typography:** Modern, clean fonts (e.g., San Francisco, Roboto)\n*   **Icons:** Minimal, line-based icons\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Project Setup:** Create a new React Native project with Expo.\n2.  **Navigation:** Implement navigation using React Navigation. This will include:\n    *   A stack navigator for the main app flow (Home, Category, Lesson, Progress, Premium Upgrade).\n    *   A separate stack navigator or modal for the Onboarding flow (Create Account/Log In, Add Dog Profile).\n3.  **Screens:** Create the following screens:\n    *   Onboarding:\n        *   Create Account/Log In\n        *   Add Dog Profile (name, age, breed optional)\n    *   Home/Training Hub\n    *   Category Screen\n    *   Lesson Screen\n    *   Progress Screen\n    *   Premium Upgrade Screen\n4.  **Components:** Create reusable components for:\n    *   Training Category Cards/Tiles\n    *   Lesson List Items\n    *   Instruction Cards\n    *   Buttons (Start Session, Mark Complete)\n    *   Progress Bars\n5.  **Data:** Define data structures for:\n    *   Dog Profile\n    *   Training Categories\n    *   Lessons (including video/image URLs, instructions, difficulty, time)\n6.  **Logic:** Implement basic logic for:\n    *   Marking lessons as complete\n    *   Tracking progress\n    *   Locking/unlocking lessons based on premium status\n    *   Displaying ads for free users\n7.  **Styling:** Apply the specified dark mode UI and red accent highlights to all screens and components.\n\nNow, I will instruct the coding agent to implement the plan and modify the app/(tabs) folder to implement the changes and make the changes visible for the user.\n\nFinally, the coding agent should remove the modalDemos array from app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-12-13T22:55:49.112212"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll build the HEEL dog training app for you!

This is a common issue with Expo projects, and while the error message itself is generic, it usually points to a problem in the build configuration or environment.\n\nHere's a breakdown of potential causes and how to address them:\n\n1.  **Node Modules Issues:**\n    *   **Inconsistent Dependencies:** Delete your `node_modules` folder, and `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock` file. Then run `npm install` or `yarn install` to ensure you have a clean and consistent set of dependencies.\n    *   **Native Module Compatibility:** Some native modules might have compatibility issues with the Expo SDK version you're using. Check the documentation for each native module to ensure it's compatible. If not, you might need to update the module or downgrade your Expo SDK version.\n\n2.  **Expo Configuration:**\n    *   **`app.json` or `app.config.js`:** Review your Expo configuration file for any syntax errors or misconfigurations.\n    *   **Conflicting Plugins:** Ensure there are no conflicting plugins in your `app.json` or `app.config.js` file.\n\n3.  **EAS Build Configuration:**\n    *   **`eas.json`:** Check your EAS build configuration file for any errors.\n    *   **Build Secrets:** Verify that any required build secrets (API keys, etc.) are correctly configured in EAS.\n\n4.  **Environment Issues:**\n    *   **Node.js Version:** Ensure you're using a compatible Node.js version. Expo recommends using an LTS version.\n    *   **Global Packages:** Outdated or conflicting global packages can sometimes cause issues. Try updating `expo-cli` globally: `npm install -g expo-cli`.\n\n5.  **Caching Issues:**\n    *   **Metro Bundler Cache:** Reset the Metro bundler cache by running `expo start -c`.\n    *   **EAS Build Cache:** Clear the EAS build cache by running `eas build --clear-cache`.\n\nGiven that you've already tried some fixes related to `react-native-maps` and bundle identifiers, I recommend focusing on the following steps:\n\n1.  **Clean Install:** Delete `node_modules`, `package-lock.json` (or `yarn.lock`), and run `npm install` (or `yarn install`).\n2.  **Review Expo Configuration:** Carefully examine your `app.json` or `app.config.js` file for any errors.\n3.  **Update Expo CLI:** Ensure you have the latest version of `expo-cli` installed globally.\n4.  **Clear Caches:** Reset the Metro bundler cache (`expo start -c`) and the EAS build cache (`eas build --clear-cache`).\n\nIf the issue persists, please provide the following information so I can assist you further:\n\n*   Your `app.json` or `app.config.js` file.\n*   The exact Expo SDK version you're using.\n*   The Node.js version you're using.\n*   The output of `expo doctor`.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-12-21T08:57:58.273923"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you fix this build error.

Try clearing the cache by running `expo start -c`.\n4.  **Restart the Development Server:** After clearing the cache, restart the Expo development server to ensure the changes are picked up.\n\nIf the issue persists after these steps, there might be a problem with how the dependency is being imported or used in your code.

But having `react-native-worklets` installed can cause conflicts during the export/build phase\n\nSince you're not using `react-native-worklets` anywhere in your code, we should remove it from package.json. However, I cannot modify package.json dependencies directly through the tools available. \n\nInstead, let me provide you with the solution:\n\n## Solution\n\nThe issue is caused by having `react-native-worklets` (version 0.5.1) installed alongside `react-native-reanimated` 4.x. These two packages conflict because Reanimated 4.x has worklets functionality built-in.\n\n**To fix this error, you need to:**\n\n1. **Remove the conflicting dependency** by running this command in your terminal:\n   ```bash\n   npm uninstall react-native-worklets\n   ```\n   or if using yarn:\n   ```bash\n   yarn remove react-native-worklets\n   ```\n\n2. **Clear your build cache:**\n   ```bash\n   expo start -c\n   ```\n\n3. **Try building again:**\n   ```bash\n   eas build -p ios --profile development\n   ```\n\nThe babel configuration is already correct - it's using `react-native-reanimated/plugin` which is the right plugin for Reanimated 4.x.\n\n---\n\n**Why this happens:**\n\n- `react-native-reanimated` version 4.x includes worklets functionality natively\n- Having a separate `react-native-worklets` package creates conflicts during the build/export phase\n- The Expo export process fails because it encounters conflicting worklet implementations\n\n**After removing the package**, your app should build successfully without any code changes needed!"}, {"type": "lint", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "lint", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "build", "build_type": "build", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "commit", "commit_id": "fb9aa2a67562f0021b523915ab5fdcc2547012d3", "message": "chore: Provide instructions to remove react-native-worklets", "timestamp": "2025-12-21T09:48:11Z", "files_changed": ["babel.config.js"], "update_number": 47, "parent_commit_id": "c11b88b2daf0e65b703274c19cee1e6d5b1c29a1"}], "timestamp": "2025-12-21T09:45:23Z"}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Scan all lesson screens across all categories.

Avoid string mismatches like \u201cpremiumComingSoon\u201d vs \u201cpremium-coming-soon\u201d.\n\nAdd a console log or temporary on-screen debug label showing computed flags for the opened lesson: isPremium, isLocked, lockReason.

Let's try reading `contexts/WidgetContext.tsx`.\n"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "contexts/WidgetContext.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "text", "text": "`contexts/WidgetContext.tsx` doesn't seem to be related to IAP either. It appears to be for widget functionality.\n\nI'm still missing the location of the IAP logic and the \"Premium Coming Soon\" screen. Given the limitations of the available tools, I'm unable to pinpoint the exact files.\n\nHowever, based on the prompt and the information I've gathered, here's a plan to address the user's issue:\n\n1.  **Locate the IAP logic:** Manually inspect the codebase (outside of this environment) for RevenueCat or StoreKit integrations. Look for files that handle product fetching, purchase validation, and price display.\n2.  **Identify the \"Premium Coming Soon\" screen:** Search for the component that renders the \"Premium Coming Soon\" UI. It might be a modal, a separate screen, or part of another component.\n3.  **Implement the \"Debug: IAP\" section:** Add a new section in the Settings screen (likely `app/(tabs)/profile.tsx`) that displays the following information:\n    *   Active premium product IDs (fetch these from RevenueCat/StoreKit).\n    *   Localized prices for each product (fetch these from RevenueCat/StoreKit).\n    *   A label indicating whether the UI price is coming from store product objects or hardcoded strings.\n4.  **Update pricing in App Store Connect/RevenueCat:** Ensure the product prices are updated in the respective platforms.\n5.  **Replace hardcoded prices:** Modify the UI to use the localized prices fetched from RevenueCat/StoreKit. Implement a fallback mechanism in case the product data fails to load.\n6.  **Verify routing to \"Premium Coming Soon\":** Double-check the navigation logic to ensure that tapping on a premium lesson always leads to the \"Premium Coming Soon\" screen.\n7.  **Test the changes:** Thoroughly test the IAP flow, the \"Premium Coming Soon\" screen, and the admin/tester mode.\n\nSince I cannot directly modify the code, I recommend providing these instructions to the developer who has access to the codebase. They should be able to locate the relevant files and implement the necessary changes.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-12-22T03:44:57.661443"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you implement the IAP debugging features and pricing updates.

Now let me create a summary document for the user:\n\n## Summary of Changes\n\nI've successfully implemented all the requested IAP debugging features and pricing updates for your HEEL dog training app. Here's what was done:\n\n### \u2705 **1. Debug: IAP Section (Settings Screen)**\n- **Location**: Settings \u2192 Debug: IAP (visible only when tester mode is enabled)\n- **Displays**:\n  - Active premium product IDs (monthly: `heel_premium_monthly`, yearly: `heel_premium_yearly`)\n  - Store prices status (currently shows \"[Not connected to store]\" since no IAP SDK is integrated)\n  - UI price source indicator (shows \"\u26a0\ufe0f Hardcoded fallback strings\")\n  - Current pricing display ($4.99/mo, $39.99/yr)\n  - Environment detection (Development/Preview vs Production Build)\n  - Clear warning that no IAP SDK is integrated yet\n\n### \u2705 **2. Pricing Updates**\n- **Updated all pricing from**:\n  - ~~$9.99/month~~ \u2192 **$4.99/month**\n  - ~~$79.99/year~~ \u2192 **$39.99/year**\n- **Updated in**:\n  - Settings screen (Premium section)\n  - Premium tab screen\n  - Upgrade alerts\n\n### \u2705 **3. Admin Debug Labels on Lesson Screen**\n- **Location**: Lesson screen (visible only when tester mode is enabled)\n- **Displays**:\n  - `isPremium`: Shows if lesson is premium\n  - `isLocked`: Shows if lesson is locked\n  - `lockReason`: Shows why it's locked (premium/prerequisite/N/A)\n  - `Route pushed`: Shows which route will be navigated to when tapped\n\n### \u2705 **4. Preview Mode vs Real Build Notice**\n- Added clear messaging in the Debug: IAP section explaining:\n  - **Preview/Development mode**: Cannot display live StoreKit prices\n  - **Production/TestFlight builds**: Can connect to App Store for real pricing\n  - Recommendation to test in TestFlight for accurate price display\n\n### \ud83d\udd10 **Tester Mode Access**\n- **Activation**: Tap app version 7 times in Settings \u2192 Enter code \"JAGARRIOS\"\n- **Persists**: Saved via AsyncStorage\n- **Unlocks**:\n  - Debug: IAP section\n  - Admin Waitlist screen\n  - Debug labels on lesson screens\n\n### \ud83d\udcdd **Important Notes**\n\n1. **No IAP SDK Integrated**: The app currently has NO RevenueCat or StoreKit integration. All prices are hardcoded fallback strings. To display live prices:\n   - Integrate RevenueCat SDK or native StoreKit\n   - Create products in App Store Connect with IDs: `heel_premium_monthly` and `heel_premium_yearly`\n   - Update the code to fetch and display live prices from the store\n\n2. **Preview Limitations**: The Natively preview environment cannot display live StoreKit/RevenueCat prices. The Debug: IAP section clearly indicates this and recommends testing in TestFlight.\n\n3. **Admin Access**: The \"Open Premium Coming Soon\" button is already available in the Debug section (Dev/TestFlight builds) for quick testing.\n\n### \ud83c\udfaf **Next Steps for Real IAP Integration**\n\nWhen you're ready to implement actual in-app purchases:\n\n1. **Choose an IAP solution**:\n   - RevenueCat (recommended - easier, handles cross-platform)\n   - Native StoreKit (iOS) + Google Play Billing (Android)\n\n2. **Create products in App Store Connect**:\n   - Product ID: `heel_premium_monthly` at $4.99/month\n   - Product ID: `heel_premium_yearly` at $39.99/year\n\n3. **Integrate the SDK** and update the code to:\n   - Fetch products on app launch\n   - Display `product.localizedPrice` instead of hardcoded strings\n   - Handle purchase flows\n   - Validate receipts\n\nAll the infrastructure for debugging and testing is now in place! \ud83c\udf89"}, {"type": "lint", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "lint", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "build", "build_type": "build", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "commit", "commit_id": "a62bd93f081e5fbe93231c4905e01c4a550de052", "message": "feat: Add IAP debug tools, update prices, and admin labels\n", "timestamp": "2025-12-22T03:53:05Z", "files_changed": ["app/(tabs)/settings.tsx", "app/(tabs)/premium.tsx", "app/lesson.tsx"], "update_number": 57, "parent_commit_id": "49db44358fd8ff997e63b05d14aeb575477bacab"}], "timestamp": "2025-12-22T03:44:21Z"}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Update Premium messaging to remove free trial + remove pricing and keep Premium as \u201cComing Soon\u201d only.\n\nRemove \u201cFree Trial\u201d everywhere\n\nRemove any \u201cFree trial\u201d, \u201cStart free trial\u201d, \u201cTrial\u201d, or trial-length language from all premium-related UI:\n\nPremium tab screen\n\nSettings \u2192 Premium section\n\nAny upgrade alerts/popups\n\nAny callouts on lesson lists or lesson screens\n\nReplace CTAs with non-trial language:\n\n\u201cPremium Coming Soon\u201d\n\n\u201cJoin the waitlist\u201d\n\n\u201cGet notified\u201d\n\nRemove pricing display everywhere\n\nRemove any visible pricing strings like \u201c$4.99/month\u201d, \u201c$39.99/year\u201d, \u201cper month\u201d, \u201cper year\u201d from:\n\nPremium tab screen\n\nSettings premium area\n\nAny upgrade modals/alerts\n\nAny Premium Coming Soon screen\n\nReplace with neutral copy:\n\n\u201cPremium will unlock advanced lessons, roadmaps, and analytics.\u201d\n\n\u201cJoin the waitlist to be notified when Premium launches.\u201d\n\nEnsure Premium Coming Soon is the only premium flow\n\nAny interaction with premium lessons (tap on a premium lesson row/card OR \u201cLearn More\u201d OR tapping a lock overlay) must always navigate to the Premium Coming Soon screen.\n\nNo dead taps: tapping must always do something (navigate).\n\nIf a lesson is premium-only, the tap should route even if the lesson is also within a premium-only category.\n\nFix \u201ctap does nothing\u201d on premium lessons (Handler Training, etc.)\n\nIn premium-only categories where every lesson is premium, ensure list items are still pressable.\nCommon cause: the Pressable/onPress is disabled when locked.\nFix:\n\nDo NOT disable the Pressable for premium locked lessons.\n\nInstead keep it enabled and route to Premium Coming Soon.\n\nAdd a temporary admin-only debug label on that screen (tester mode) showing:\n\nisPremium, isLocked, lockReason, and route pushed\nso we can confirm it\u2019s being detected and routed correctly.\n\nKeep tester/admin code gate\n\nKeep \u201cJAGARRIOS\u201d tester code unlock exactly as is.\n\nDeliverable: No free trial copy anywhere, no pricing shown anywhere, premium lessons always open Premium Coming Soon (no dead taps), including in Handler Training."}]}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Okay, I understand.
