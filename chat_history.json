You want me to create a plan for a React Native + Expo 54 app called \"HEEL\" for modern dog training. The app should have a sleek, athletic, premium dark mode UI with red accents, and function like a gym workout app for dog training. Here's the plan:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n*   **Home/Training Hub:** Display dog name, progress summary, and training categories (Everyday Obedience, Leash & Walks, Calm & Focus, Recall, Mental Work) as clean cards or tiles.\n*   **Category Screen:** Show a list of lessons within the selected category, including lesson name, difficulty, estimated time, and locked/unlocked status.\n*   **Lesson Screen:** Display a video or illustrated lesson at the top, followed by step-by-step instruction cards, a \"Start Session\" button, and a \"Mark Complete\" button.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Theme:** Dark Mode\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: #121212 (Charcoal)\n    *   Text: #FFFFFF (White)\n    *   TextSecondary: #A0A0A0 (Gray)\n    *   Primary: #FF3B30 (Red)\n    *   Secondary: #1E1E1E (Dark Gray)\n    *   Accent: #FF3B30 (Red)\n    *   Card: #1E1E1E (Dark Gray)\n    *   Highlight: #FF3B30 (Red)\n*   **Typography:** Modern, clean fonts (e.g., San Francisco, Roboto)\n*   **Icons:** Minimal, line-based icons\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Project Setup:** Create a new React Native project with Expo.\n2.  **Navigation:** Implement navigation using React Navigation. This will include:\n    *   A stack navigator for the main app flow (Home, Category, Lesson, Progress, Premium Upgrade).\n    *   A separate stack navigator or modal for the Onboarding flow (Create Account/Log In, Add Dog Profile).\n3.  **Screens:** Create the following screens:\n    *   Onboarding:\n        *   Create Account/Log In\n        *   Add Dog Profile (name, age, breed optional)\n    *   Home/Training Hub\n    *   Category Screen\n    *   Lesson Screen\n    *   Progress Screen\n    *   Premium Upgrade Screen\n4.  **Components:** Create reusable components for:\n    *   Training Category Cards/Tiles\n    *   Lesson List Items\n    *   Instruction Cards\n    *   Buttons (Start Session, Mark Complete)\n    *   Progress Bars\n5.  **Data:** Define data structures for:\n    *   Dog Profile\n    *   Training Categories\n    *   Lessons (including video/image URLs, instructions, difficulty, time)\n6.  **Logic:** Implement basic logic for:\n    *   Marking lessons as complete\n    *   Tracking progress\n    *   Locking/unlocking lessons based on premium status\n    *   Displaying ads for free users\n7.  **Styling:** Apply the specified dark mode UI and red accent highlights to all screens and components.\n\nNow, I will instruct the coding agent to implement the plan and modify the app/(tabs) folder to implement the changes and make the changes visible for the user.\n\nFinally, the coding agent should remove the modalDemos array from app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-12-13T22:55:49.112212"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll build the HEEL dog training app for you!

Now let me create a summary of all the changes I've made:\n\n## Summary of Changes\n\nI've successfully implemented all the requested features for the HEEL mobile app:\n\n### 1. **Session Timer Redesign** \u2705\n- Replaced the text-based timer with a **clock icon** (timer icon)\n- Tapping the icon opens a **time wheel selector modal** with options for:\n  - 5 minutes\n  - 10 minutes\n  - 15 minutes\n- The modal has a clean, modern design with icons and better visual hierarchy\n- Timer controls remain the same (Start/Pause, Reset, Change)\n\n### 2. **Post-Session Screen Update** \u2705\nCompletely redesigned the post-session screen with:\n\n**Quick Questions:**\n- **Focus Rating**: 1-3 paw rating scale asking \"How was your dog's focus?\"\n- **Success Rating**: 1-3 paw rating scale asking \"How successful was the session?\"\n- **Energy Level**: Three buttons (Calm, Normal, Hyper) with icons\n- **Optional Text Input**: \"What did they struggle with?\"\n\n**Smart Recommendations:**\nBased on the answers, the app provides intelligent recommendations:\n- **Advance to next lesson**: When focus \u22652.5/3, success \u22652.5/3, and energy is calm\n- **Repeat this lesson**: When performance is good but not excellent\n- **Try Calm & Focus lessons**: When dog is hyperactive or struggling with distractions\n- **Practice in quieter environment**: When ratings are low\n\nThe recommendation card displays with:\n- Appropriate icon\n- Clear title\n- Actionable message\n- Visual emphasis with border and shadow\n\n### 3. **General Training Tips** \u2705\nAdded universal training tips that appear:\n- **During sessions**: A popup appears 2 seconds after entering session mode with tips like:\n  - \"Don't yell at dogs \u2014 it scares them. Redirect instead.\"\n  - \"Consistency beats perfection. Train a little every day.\"\n  - \"Reward the behavior you want to see more of.\"\n  - And 5 more rotating tips\n- Tips are dismissible and non-intrusive\n- They reinforce positive training habits\n\n### 4. **Optional Tips/Blog Section** \u2705\nCreated a new **Training Tips screen** (`/training-tips`) with:\n- **15 comprehensive training tips** covering:\n  - General training principles\n  - Training techniques\n  - Enrichment ideas\n  - Puppy-specific advice\n- **Category filtering**: All, General, Training, Enrichment, Puppies\n- **Expandable cards**: Tap to read full tip content\n- **Clean, organized layout** with icons for each tip\n- **Accessible from home screen**: Added a prominent card on the home screen linking to this section\n\n### Key Features:\n- **Non-mandatory**: Users can access tips when they want\n- **Lightweight**: Simple, fast-loading interface\n- **Educational**: Reinforces best practices throughout the app\n- **Consistent design**: Matches the HEEL app's dark, premium aesthetic\n\n### Files Modified:\n1. `app/session-mode.tsx` - Complete redesign of timer and post-session flow\n2. `app/training-tips.tsx` - New screen for tips library\n3. `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` - Added link to training tips\n\nAll changes maintain the app's premium, athletic aesthetic with the dark theme, red accents, and clean typography. The features are fully functional and ready for testing!"}, {"type": "lint", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "lint", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "build", "build_type": "build", "status": "complete", "success": true}], "timestamp": "2025-12-21T06:32:44Z"}]
